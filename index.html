    <h2>Programming Is Art<br>
    <span>Poem by Tea Kawana</span>
    </h2>
    <p>As if he were a painter,<br>
    he interpreted his thoughts using colour,<br>
    with his tools:<br>
    several brushes and a paint palette.<br>
    As if he played in some orchestra or band,<br>
    and the notes from the sheet music were <br>
    expressed through the very contact of his <br>
    instrument and himself; <br> 
    and the translation of the incomprehensible<br> 
    beautiful marks on the sheet, <br> 
    to a set theme, one could envision in the mind,<br> 
    was impeccably evident through play.<br>
    As if he were a dancer,<br>
    having polished up all the various essential techniquesâ€¦<br>
    and how the flexibility and movement of his body<br>
    extract the notation to beautiful action.<br>
    Through his own specialty,<br> 
    I see all these come into play,<br> 
    I see art. </p>
